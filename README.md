# COPD Detection using Respiratory Audio Signals

This project presents a machine learning pipeline to detect **Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)** from respiratory sound recordings. Using handcrafted acoustic features and ensemble learning models, the system is optimized for potential low-cost screening in clinical or remote environments.

## üß™ Workflow Summary

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Balanced Dataset
- Subset of the dataset selected with **26 COPD** and **26 non-COPD** samples.
- Applied MFCC (Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients) feature extraction.
- Trained on multiple models including:
  - Random Forest (RF)
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  - Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
  - Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
- **Best Accuracy:**  
  ‚úÖ Random Forest achieved **96.2% accuracy** on the balanced dataset.

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Full Dataset (Imbalanced)
- Expanded dataset to include **64 COPD** and **62 non-COPD** samples (some versions may vary slightly).
- Noticed **class imbalance**, which affected performance.
- Applied **SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique)** to balance the data.
- Used **5-Fold Cross-Validation** for reliable evaluation.
- **Accuracy Across Models:**  
  ‚úÖ Achieved **~88‚Äì89% accuracy** consistently across RF, SVM, ANN after SMOTE and CV.
